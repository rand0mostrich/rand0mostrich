- 👋 Hola 👋 -

- 💞️ I’m interested in many things. Some of those things happen to be technology related 💞️ -

- In the event and under the umbrella of technology related interests, lays a self taught, informally trained but easily inspired and with a yearning -
-  for the knowledge of and for certain skillsets that are deemed less necessary by society. You could say i'm a script kiddy for a h4x0r or a want to be, but I do not think it is something -
- somebody chooses. You either are or you are not. It can never be limited to any specific technological advancement as commonly is. Instead, I feel that it -
- is a way of thinking as well as behaving/performing; a way of life. -

-  ✨ Let this be the space for my contribtion of any coding or ✨ -
-  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I can when I can 🌱 - 
- 
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate, append, inquire, create and inform 👀 -

- 👋 adios 👋 -
